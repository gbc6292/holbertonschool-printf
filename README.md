# Custom printf Function

This is a custom printf function in C, designed to print strings, characters, and integers based on a provided format string.

## Usage

To use this custom printf function, include the header file `main.h` in your C program and call the function using the following syntax:

```markdown
_printf(format, arg1, arg2, ...)

- `format` is a string that specifies how to format the output, using format specifiers that begin with a `%` character.
- `arg1`, `arg2`, etc. are the arguments to be printed, which must correspond to the format specifiers in the format string.
```

The function returns the total number of characters printed or 0 if the format string or argument list is empty.

## Supported Format Specifiers

The following format specifiers are currently supported by the custom printf function:
```markdown
- `%c` - print a single character
- `%s` - print a string
- `%%` - print a literal `%` character
- `%d` or `%i` - print an integer
```

## Helper Functions

The custom printf function is implemented using several helper functions:

```markdown
- `print_char(char a)` - prints a single character using `_putchar` function and returns the number 1 to indicate that it printed one character.
- `print_string(char *b)` - prints a string using `_putchar` function and returns the number of characters printed.
- `pr_int(int n)` - prints an integer recursively using `_putchar` function and returns the total number of characters printed.
```

**Note:**
```
- The `_putchar` function is used to print characters in this implementation. This function is not a standard C function and may have different implementations depending on the environment.
- This implementation does not currently support all of the features and format specifiers of the standard `printf` function in C.
- This implementation may have limitations or issues depending on the specific requirements and use cases.
```

# Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the custom printf function:

```markdown
#include "main.h"

int main()
{
    int num = 12345;
    char* str = "Hello, world!";

    _printf("Printing a character: %c\n", 'A');
    _printf("Printing a string: %s\n", str);
    _printf("Printing a percent sign: %%\n");
    _printf("Printing an integer: %d\n", num);

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Printing a character: A
Printing a string: Hello, world!
Printing a percent sign: %
Printing an integer: 12345
```
